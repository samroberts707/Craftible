## A CraftCMS project boilerplate
This is a CraftCMS project boilerplate, designed to guide people from the start of a project all the way to production deployment. Local dev will take place with Ansible/Vagrant box. Frontend files will be compiled using SCSS via NPM. Finally Ansible will be used to deploy the project to both staging and production environments.
